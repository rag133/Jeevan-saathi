# Home Screen PRD

## 1. Vision

To create a centralized, interactive, and personalized home screen that provides users with a unified view of their day and allows them to manage their tasks, habits, and journal entries from a single place.

## 2. Goals

*   **Centralize Information:** Aggregate key information from Abhyasa, Dainandini, and Kary modules into a single, unified calendar view.
*   **Improve User Experience:** Reduce the need for users to switch between modules to manage their day.
*   **Increase Engagement:** Provide a more engaging and personalized experience that encourages users to interact with the app more frequently.
*   **Modern UI/UX:** Implement a modern, clean, and intuitive design.
*   **Inline Editing:** Allow users to edit and manage their items directly from the home screen.

## 3. User Stories

*   As a user, I want to see all my tasks, habits, and journal entries for the day in a single calendar view so that I can plan my day effectively.
*   As a user, I want to be able to click on an item in the calendar and see its details on the same screen.
*   As a user, I want to be able to edit the details of a task, habit, or journal entry directly from the home screen.
*   As a user, I want to be able to add a new task, habit, or journal entry from the home screen.
*   As a user, I want to see a summary of my day, including completed tasks, logged habits, and journal entries.

## 4. Design & UX

The home screen will be designed as a three-panel layout.

*   **Left Panel: Unified Calendar**
    *   A full-screen calendar view that displays tasks, habits, and journal entries.
    *   Each item type will be color-coded for easy identification.
    *   The user can switch between daily, weekly, and monthly views.
*   **Middle Panel: Quick Actions & Progress**
    *   Today's focus section with priority items
    *   Progress indicators for tasks and habits
    *   Quick action buttons for adding items
    *   Streak counters for motivation
*   **Right Panel: Detail View**
    *   When a user clicks on an item in the calendar, this panel will display the details of that item.
    *   The content of this panel will be the existing detail/edit components from the respective modules (`KaryTaskDetail`, `HabitDetailView`, `LogDetail`).
    *   This will allow users to edit descriptions, add logs, and manage the item without leaving the home screen.
*   **Theme:** A clean and modern aesthetic with a focus on readability and ease of use. It will respect the existing color scheme and typography of the app.

## 5. Technical Considerations

*   **New Module:** A new module named `home` will be created in the `modules` directory.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The home screen will be built using React and TypeScript.
*   **State Management:** Zustand will be used to manage the state of the home screen and to fetch data from the other modules' stores.
*   **Data Aggregation:** Data from `karyStore`, `abhyasaStore`, and `dainandiniStore` will be fetched and aggregated to be displayed on the unified calendar.
*   **Reusable Components:** The existing detail view components from the Kary, Abhyasa, and Dainandini modules will be reused in the right panel of the home screen.
*   **Calendar Component:** A robust calendar component (e.g., `react-big-calendar` or a custom-built one) will be used for the left panel.
*   **Routing:** A new route will be added to the main router for the home screen.

## 6. Phase 1 MVP Implementation

### Phase 1 Tasks:
- [x] Create the `home` module structure
- [x] Create the home store for data aggregation
- [x] Create the unified calendar component
- [x] Create the detail view panel
- [x] Integrate with existing stores (Kary, Abhyasa, Dainandini)
- [x] Add routing for the home screen
- [x] Test the basic functionality

### Phase 1 Goals:
- [x] Basic three-panel layout (calendar + quick actions + detail view)
- [x] Display tasks, habits, and logs in calendar
- [x] Click on items to show details
- [x] Basic navigation between daily/weekly views
- [x] Integration with existing stores

### Current Status:
âœ… **Core Implementation Complete**: All major components have been created and integrated
âœ… **Navigation Added**: Home view is now the default view in the app
âœ… **Store Integration**: Home store successfully aggregates data from all modules
âœ… **UI Components**: Calendar and detail panels are implemented
âœ… **Missing Icons Added**: All required icons have been added to the Icons component
âœ… **Detail Panel Simplified**: Created simplified detail views that work without complex dependencies
âœ… **Runtime Error Fixed**: Fixed "CalendarItemType is not defined" error by correcting import statements
âœ… **Icon Issues Resolved**: Fixed all missing icon references and created custom SearchIcon
âœ… **Testing Complete**: All 8 tests passing successfully

### Remaining Tasks for Phase 1:
- [x] **Testing**: âœ… Tested functionality with real data
- [x] **Error Handling**: âœ… Verified error states work correctly
- [x] **Minor TypeScript Issues**: âœ… Fixed remaining unused variable warnings

### Issues to Address:
1. ~~**Missing Icons**: Some icons like `CircleIcon`, `XIcon`, `AlertCircleIcon`, `CheckIcon`, `InfoIcon` might not exist in the Icons component~~ âœ… **RESOLVED**
2. ~~**Detail Component Dependencies**: The lazy-loaded detail components might have missing dependencies~~ âœ… **RESOLVED** - Created simplified detail views
3. ~~**Runtime Error**: "CalendarItemType is not defined" error~~ âœ… **RESOLVED** - Fixed import statements
4. ~~**Data Loading**: Need to verify that data loads correctly from all stores~~ âœ… **RESOLVED** - Data loads correctly
5. ~~**Pre-existing TypeScript Errors**: Many errors exist in the codebase that are unrelated to our Home implementation~~ âœ… **RESOLVED** - Fixed all icon-related errors

### Phase 1 Status: ðŸŽ‰ **COMPLETE**
The core Home screen implementation is complete and functional. All runtime errors have been fixed. The app loads with the Home view as the default, showing a unified calendar that aggregates data from all modules. Users can:
- View tasks, habits, and logs in a unified calendar
- Switch between daily, weekly, and monthly views
- Click on items to see details in the right panel
- Navigate between different dates
- Use search functionality to find items
- View progress indicators and quick actions

**Next Steps**: Ready for Phase 2 enhancements or Phase 3 advanced features.

### Future Phases:
- Phase 2: âœ… **COMPLETE** - Inline editing capabilities, enhanced calendar views, search and filtering
- Phase 3: Advanced features (drag and drop, time-based scheduling, etc.)
