# Jeevan Saathi Monorepo Development Rules

## Project Structure
- `web/` - React web application (existing)
- `mobile/` - React Native mobile application (to be created)
- `shared/` - Code shared between web and mobile

## Code Reuse Guidelines
- ALWAYS check `shared/` directory first for existing code
- Reuse business logic, stores, and services from `shared/`
- Only create new code when absolutely necessary
- Maintain consistency between web and mobile implementations

## Development Workflow
1. Implement core logic in `shared/`
2. Adapt UI components for web in `web/src/`
3. Adapt UI components for mobile in `mobile/src/`
4. Ensure both platforms use the same data models and business logic

## Critical Rules
- NEVER modify the existing web app functionality during mobile development
- ALWAYS test web app after any changes to shared code
- Use the SAME Firebase project for both apps
- Maintain data consistency across platforms

## File Organization
- Business logic → `shared/`
- Platform-specific UI → `web/` or `mobile/`
- Types and interfaces → `shared/types/`
- Stores and state → `shared/stores/`
- Services → `shared/services/`
- Utilities → `shared/utils/`

## Testing Requirements
- Test web app functionality after any shared code changes
- Ensure mobile app works with shared code
- Maintain backward compatibility
