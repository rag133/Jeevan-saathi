# Logo Deployment Fix

## Issue
The Jeevan Saathi logo was not displaying correctly when deployed to Firebase, even though it worked fine in the local development environment. The logo appeared as a broken image placeholder with misaligned text.

## Root Cause
The project uses a custom build script (`build.mjs`) with esbuild instead of Vite's standard build process. The build script was not copying static assets from the `public` directory to the `dist` directory, which is required for Firebase hosting.

## Solution
Updated the build script (`build.mjs`) to include copying of the public directory:

```javascript
// Copy public directory assets
const { cp } = await import('fs/promises');
if (existsSync('public')) {
  await cp('public', join(BUILD_DIR, 'public'), { recursive: true });
  console.log('üìÅ Public directory copied successfully');
}
```

## Additional Improvements
1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Updated the `Logo.tsx` component to include a fallback icon when the image fails to load
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Added a "JS" fallback icon with the app's brand colors when the logo image is unavailable
3. **Better User Experience**: The app now gracefully handles logo loading failures without breaking the UI

## Files Modified
- `build.mjs` - Added public directory copying
- `components/Logo.tsx` - Added error handling and fallback
- `App.tsx` - Added error handling for logo references
- `components/LoginPage.tsx` - Added error handling for logo references

## Testing
The fix has been tested and deployed to Firebase. The logo should now display correctly at: https://jeevan-saathi-39bf5.web.app

## Future Considerations
- Consider using Vite's standard build process instead of the custom esbuild setup for better asset handling
- Implement image optimization for the logo to improve loading performance
- Add loading states for better user experience during image loading
